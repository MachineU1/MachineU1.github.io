<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">A PERFORMANCE COMPARISON OF
MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF HEART
DISEASE<BR>by<BR>Henri Prudhomme and Owen Langejans</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Heart
Disease is the leading cause of death in the world today. In the
United States alone, approximately 610,000 people die of heart
disease each year. There are various indicators of heart disease
progression and allowing patients to become aware of these
vulnerability can save lives. By publishing models on our website
https://machineu1.github.io, this project can effectively demonstrate
the power of machine learning and its use in the prediction of heart
disease. The purpose of this research project was to learn various
machine learning algorithms and implement them to predict the
probability of heart disease from a dataset. The fourteen-variable
dataset used in this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Heart
Disease Repository. This repository provided over 350 data points
which were split at a 70 to 30 ratio for training and testing of each
of the models. The data points consisted of thirteen attributes and
one outcome. The models were generated from the following implemented
algorithms: The Random Forest Regression Algorithm (RFRA), the
Multivariable Linear Regression Algorithm (MLRA), and the Random
Forest Classification Algorithm (RFCA). The performance of each model
was calculated by comparing the prediction of the machine algorithm
to the actual prediction of the data point. A mean accuracy was
determined by rebuilding 1000 models for each algorithm and averaging
the resulting accuracies. The MLRA had a mean accuracy of 78.4%, the
RFCA had a mean accuracy of 98.7%, and the RFRA had a mean accuracy
of 100%. In conclusion, the RFRA and the RFCA models resulted in
near-perfect prediction of the probability of heart disease. Future
improvements could include using a larger number of unique algorithms
as well as a larger training dataset.</FONT></P>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Introduction</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When considering the medical
	industry, computers are not the first thing that comes to mind,
	rather it is the professionals who have studied the way that the
	human body works. However, in more recent times the emergence of
	machine learning has revealed new ways to diagnose and analyze
	health conditions. The goal of this project was to take a given
	dataset consisting of heart measurements and a professional
	physicians diagnosis on the probability of heart disease presence,
	create models for the data, and use new models to predict the
	presence of heart disease without the knowledge of the predetermined
	probability.</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This project used a dataset from
	the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Cleveland Heart Data (UCI). We
	chose to use this dataset because the heart data was accessible and
	was a convenient way to demonstrate the power of machine learning.
	For machine learning, it is desirable to have quantitative data. The
	Cleveland Clinic heart data dataset provided simple numeric values
	for the measured attributes of the heart. Thus, this data proved
	exceptionally readable and usable for the machine learning
	algorithms.</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The thirteen input attributes of
	the dataset used are as follows: age, gender, chest pain type,
	resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar,
	resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, exercise
	induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest,
	the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels
	colored by fluoroscopy, and defect condition. The final and
	fourteenth attribute of a single line of data is a professional
	diagnosis of the risk of heart disease. The data was spilt 70% for
	training and 30% for testing. It is important to separate the
	training data from the testing data because if all the training data
	were used as the testing data, the models would be predicting known
	value combinations defeating the purpose of training a machine
	learning model. By randomizing the training and testing pools from
	the dataset, the models can be considered more accurate in their
	predictions.</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Machine learning is a powerful
	tool that creates models which can predict the result of a given
	input. By looking at a dataset of predetermined variables and their
	outcomes, machine learning can make difficult decisions and problems
	easy to solve. There are two main methods to approach a machine
	learning project: supervised and unsupervised learning. In
	unsupervised learning, a model is built by looking at the input data
	ranges and their relationships with each other. This project applied
	a supervised learning approach that allowed models to be built by
	examining both the input and output of many different cases. By
	looking at a set of thirteen input values and a single output value,
	this projectâ€™s machine learning models can make predictions of the
	presence of heart disease. Depending on the mean accuracy of the
	model, these predictions can accurately determine what a doctor
	would ascertain from the same data if she or he were to analyze it
	himself.</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The algorithms used in this
	research project are the Random Forest Classification Algorithm
	(RFCA), the Random Forest Regression Algorithm (RFRA), and the
	Multivariable Linear Regression Algorithm (MLRA). An equation for
	each algorithm can be seen in the Appendix. In the Random Forest
	algorithms, a model is computed by creating a forest of decision
	trees which vote on the output value of a given case. A Decision
	Tree is a tree in which the nodes represent decisions, and the edges
	or branches are binary, representing possible paths from one node to
	another. By assigning an impact value to each attribute and
	determining which values most closely follow the output value, a
	decision tree randomly selects the best attributes to build a
	decision tree. The decision tree then learns by recursively
	splitting the dataset from the root onwards (in a greedy, node by
	node manner) according to the splitting metric at each decision
	node. A final decision tree can be seen in the following figure. </FONT>

	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The second type of algorithm
	used was the Multivariable Linear Regression Algorithm. In this
	algorithm, a linear regression line was computed and fitted to the
	training data. By calculating the quotient from the mean of each
	heart attribute to the mean of the output values, a r squared value
	could be calculated. From this, a relevance matrix is used to
	determine the diagnose the presence of heart disease. </FONT>

	was calculated by taking a mean of the performance accuracies for
