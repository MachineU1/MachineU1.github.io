Disease is the leading cause of death in the world today. In the
United States alone, approximately 610,000 people die of heart
disease each year. There are various indicators of heart disease
progression and allowing patients to become aware of these
vulnerability can save lives. By publishing models on our website
https://machineu1.github.io, this project can effectively demonstrate
the power of machine learning and its use in the prediction of heart
disease. The purpose of this research project was to learn various
machine learning algorithms and implement them to predict the
probability of heart disease from a dataset. The fourteen-variable
dataset used in this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Heart
Disease Repository. This repository provided over 350 data points
which were split at a 70 to 30 ratio for training and testing of each
of the models. The data points consisted of thirteen attributes and
one outcome. The models were generated from the following implemented
algorithms: The Random Forest Regression Algorithm (RFRA), the
Multivariable Linear Regression Algorithm (MLRA), and the Random
Forest Classification Algorithm (RFCA). The performance of each model
was calculated by comparing the prediction of the machine algorithm
to the actual prediction of the data point. A mean accuracy was
determined by rebuilding 1000 models for each algorithm and averaging
the resulting accuracies. The MLRA had a mean accuracy of 72.3%, the
RFCA had a mean accuracy of 97.8%, and the RFRA had a mean accuracy
of 100%. In conclusion, the RFRA and the RFCA models resulted in
near-perfect prediction of the probability of heart disease. Future
improvements could include using a larger number of unique algorithms
	as well as a larger training dataset.</FONT></P></b>
